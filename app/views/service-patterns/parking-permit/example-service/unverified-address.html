	<h2 class="heading-medium">What this means</h2>
	<p>
		This means you can't get a 12 month resident's permit today.
	</p>
	<p>
		 However, you can get a 3 month permit today. 10 days before it expires, you'll be able to apply for a full length permit with GOV.UK Verify â€“ you'll have lived there long enough by then.
