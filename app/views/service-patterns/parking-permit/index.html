      <p>
         This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering resident's parking permits services effectively. <a href="/">Read more about service patterns.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user need?</h2>
      <p>
        Residents need a place to park their car near their house. Parking permit services makes sure that parking spaces are only occupied by residents by making it illegal to park in a given area without a permit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What do councils need from users to deliver the service?</h2>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          proof that the user lives in the area
        </li>
        <li>
          the registration number of the vehicle to be permitted
        </li>
        <li>
          payment (this is to support the cost of the service and will vary across councils and potentially within service, depending on the type of vehicle, engine size, parking zone and others)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What is the user journey?</h2>
      <p>
        At a high level, these are the steps users should need to go through.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">1. Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Users need to find out about the parking permits service before they need to park their car. There are a number of ways users could find out about the service, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          information from their estate agent when they buy their house
        </li>
        <li>
          information from the council when they sign up for council tax
        </li>
        <li>
          signage in the street
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Local authorities should make sure the right information is being provided through these channels.
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">2. Finding the right council</h3>
      <p>
        Once the user has found out they need a permit, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'parking permit' into a search engine, or they might start on the council's website where they think they need a permit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parking-permit">The parking permits page on GOV.UK</a> should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may also go straight to the website for the council that they think they need to get a permit from. This makes it very important that councils clearly state which area their parking permit service serves as the user may be in the wrong place. Read the next section for details on this.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">3. Council start page</h3>
      <p>
        Now the user is in the right place, the page on the council's website should communicate:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          the different types of permit the user can apply for (if applicable)
        </li>
        <li>
          permit eligibility requirements
        </li>
        <li>
          where the permit they are applying for will allow them to park
        </li>
        <li>
          at what time the permit they are applying for will allow them to park
        </li>
        <li>
          how much the permit will cost
        </li>
        <li>
          how long the permit is valid for
        </li>
        <li>
          that they will need to prove where they live (using GOV.UK Verify)
        </li>
        <li>
          how long the process usually takes
        </li>
        <li>
          what to do if they need assistance with the application
        </li>
      </ul>
      <a href="parking-permit/example-service/start-page">See the example council start page</a>

      <h3 class="heading-small">4. Prove you are a resident</h3>
      <p>
        Using GOV.UK Verify, the user can securely prove their identity and their address.
      </p>
      
      {% include "common-content/verify-tech.html" %}

      <a href="http://govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/intro?requestId=apply-for-parking-permit-argleton">Step through the GOV.UK Verify journey prototype</a> (username is pirate / password is bunting)
      <h3 class="heading-small">5. Confirm address and eligibility</h3>
      <p>
        When the council receives the user's identity back from GOV.UK Verify, they should check whether or not the person or the household already has a parking permit. For some councils this may affect the price, for others it might mean the user can not have another permit.
      </p>
      <p>
        GOV.UK Verify will send the council the user's address, as known by the user's chosen identity provider. On returning from the GOV.UK Verify process, the council should ask the user to confirm whether or not this is their current address.
      </p>
      <a href="parking-permit/example-service/confirm-address">See the example page asking users to confirm their name and address</a>
      <p>
        If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. The user should then be asked to enter their current address and warned that they must not enter false information.
      </p>
      <a href="parking-permit/example-service/incorrect-address">See the example page asking users to enter their current address</a>
      <p>
        If the permit is physical, councils will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the permit to the address given. Councils should mention they'll be using the address for this purpose on the confirmation page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the permit is digital and councils want extra confidence of eligibility, they can issue a temporary permit for at least 3 months. After this time, the user's identity provider should have the new address and the user can reapply.
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-small">5a. Does the user live in the area?</h4>
      <p>
        At this point the council should check whether or the user lives in the eligible area, and then show a message to the user confirming they are eligible. This is done by checking the user's address against a council held database of parking permit zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/not-eligible-address">See the example page which says the user is not eligible because of their address</a>
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-small">5b. Does the user or the user's address already have a permit?</h4>
      <p>
        Some councils have limits on the number of people who can get a permit, or number of permits allowed per address. At the same time as check addresss eligibility (from the point of view of the user), the council should check whether or not there are any permits currently assigned to the person or their address and issue an ineligible message if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/not-eligible-permits-exceeded">See the example page which says the user is not eligible because they have exceeded the number of permits allowed</a>
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-small">5c. Is the user the only resident?</h4>
      <p>
        If the address has exceeded the number of permits allowed, but the user has not, then the council should ask the user if they are the only resident. If the user answer is no, the council should tell the user that other residents at their address may have used their permit allowance.
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          <a href="parking-permit/example-service/only-resident">See the example page which asks the user if they are the only resident</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="parking-permit/example-service/not-eligible-permits-exceeded-another-resident">See the example page which says another resident may have used your address' permit allowance</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="heading-small">5d. Did the user recently move in?</h4>
      <p>
        If the user is the only resident, but there are permits assigned to somebody else at the address, the council should ask if the user has moved in since the time the old permit was bought.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/moved-in">See the example page which asks the user if they have recently moved</a>
      </p>
      <h4 class="heading-small">5e. Cancelling old permits and next steps</h4>
      <p>
        If they have recently moved in, the existing permit(s) may belong to a previous resident. Notify the user of how to cancel the old permit. The old permits cancellation process after a grace period of 30 days and a letter will be sent to the old permit holder to reverse the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/not-eligible-permits-exceeded-old-resident">See the example page which tells the user about cancelling old permits</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If they have not recently moved in, and they are the only resident, but there are old permits registered to the address, the user now falls into an unforeseen case. The user will now need to contact the council to prove their address and cancel the old permits.
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          <a href="#">See the example page saying the user needs to contact the council</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="parking-permit/example-service/eligible">See the example page which says the user is eligible</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="heading-small">6. Enter license number</h3>
      <p>
        The council should now ask the user to enter the registration number of the car they wish to pay a permit for.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/enter-reg">See the example page of asking for a registration number</a>
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small">7. Pay</h3>
      <p>
        The fee will vary based on the fee calculation rules determined by each individual council.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/pay/choose-payment">See the example page of accepting payments.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Councils can accept payment via a number of channels, including checks, bank transfers or online payments. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/g-cloud-buyers-guide">Councils can find a supplier on the Digital Marketplace.</a></p>
      <p>
        In the future, councils will be able to accept payments using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-pay/govuk-pay">GOV.UK Pay</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">8. Receive permit confirmation</h3>
      <p>
        After payment, the user needs to receive a confirmation of payment and an acknowledgement that their application has been successful. They should also receive information about how the permit will be enforced (See step 8).
      </p>

      <p>
        The service should ask the user how they would like to receive this confirmation of payment, offering the choice of email, letter or text. <a href="/contact">See the example page on how to do this.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, councils will be able to send this confirmation using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-notify/govuk-notify">GOV.UK Notify</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">9. Checking permits</h3>
      <p>
        It's better for users and cheaper for government if the permits are issued electronically. Wardens check the permits by entering number plates into a database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Councils who haven't yet moved over to an electronic permit system, should have a plan in place to move over. </p>
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, councils should mention in the payment receipt
      </p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>
          how long they will need to wait for a permit to be posted to them
        </li>
        <li>
          where they can pick up their permit from to get it faster
        </li>
        <li>
          if they can print a temporary permit themselves while they wait for a permanent one
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information should also be communicated on the council's start page at the beginning of the user journey.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">10. Renewals</h3>
      <p>
        Councils should remind users when it's time for them to renew their permits. They should do this using the same contact method as used in the payment receipt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="#">See the example renewal notification.</a> (page in progress)
