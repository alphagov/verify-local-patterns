	          The pass can be used on many bus services throughout England, as part of the English national concessionary travel scheme (ENCTS).
	          Local buses may include some tour buses and long-distance coach services that are registered as local bus services.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          They don’t usually include sightseeing tours, other tourist related services, or services where the fare includes payment for another service, for example car parking in the case of Park-and-Ride.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          National coach services are not generally included. National Express offers <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/waystosave/senior-coachcard.aspx">a fare reduction card</a> to people over 60. This is different from the older person's bus pass.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Check with the bus operator if in doubt.
