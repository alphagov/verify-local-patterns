              <p>
                Your service webpage should show the user their date of birth and ask them to confirm it. (This is mainly done because of a legal requirement to show user the data about them received from GOV.UK Verify.)

                <p>
                  GOV.UK Verify will send your service the user's address, as supplied by the user's chosen identity provider. When the user returns from the GOV.UK Verify process, your service webpage should ask them to confirm if this is their current address. (This is mainly done because GOV.UK Verify identity providers may not have the user's address if they moved house in the last 3 months.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  On this page you can also ask the user to confirm if they want your service to send the bus pass to the address they've received through GOV.UK Verify.

                  If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. Your service should ask users to enter their current address and warn them not to enter false information, as this is a civic offence. </p>
                <p>
                  If the travel pass is physical, your service will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the pass to the address the user provided. Mention that your service will be using the address they've given for this purpose on the service confirmation page.

                When the user has confirmed their address, your service should check that the address they've given is in the area your council provides services for. If the address is not in the area, your service webpage should tell them they are not eligible in this area.

                Concessionary travel passes need a clear photograph of the person who the pass is issued to, so that they can't be used by anybody else. Bus drivers are responsibile for checking the photo matches the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users can take a photo with their webcam as part of their application, or upload a digital photograph of themselves. Uploading a photo may be complicated for some users, so your service should find the right route for them with a series of questions, illustrated in this flow chart:

              <p>
                Your service should send a letter with the pass providing information on how, when and where it can be used, and what to do in case of a lost or stolen pass.

                Bus passes are a physical plastic card that successful applicants can use on any bus in England. They need to either show it to the driver or scan on a card reader when they get onto the bus.

                In London, the pass is an Oyster card which the user scans on a card reader.

                To reduce the possibility of fraud, bus passes need to have expiry dates no more than 5 years from the date of issue. (Specification 1.31 from the
