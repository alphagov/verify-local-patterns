        Local government service patterns
      </h1>

      <p>
        These guidance pages are for people who work in local government. They outline best practice for delivering digital services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service patterns have been designed collaboratively by GDS and the councils involved in the <a href="http://www.localdigitalcoalition.uk/product/extension-of-gov-uk-verify-to-local-government-pilot/">Verify Local pilots</a>. The patterns are based on <a href="https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/14/collaborative-user-research-for-verifylocal-discovery/">user research done in Discovery</a>, and were iterated to reflect 4 rounds of testing with real users in Alpha.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is now at Beta stage, with councils beginning to implement GDS recommendations.
