    <li>Proving your identity online with GOV.UK Verify</li>
    <li>Scanning and uploading identity documents to be checked by the local authority</li>
    <li>Offline applications, such as in person or by post</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To support their decision making, users need to be aware of the relative beneifts of each approach.</p>
  <p>Those who are unlikely to be successful with GOV.UK Verify will be directed to aleternate routes.</p>

  <h3 class="heading-small">GOV.UK Verify identification route</h3>
    The government standard for identity verification is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>. Using GOV.UK Verify, the user can securely prove their identity. The service can also recieve the user's address {{"and date of birth" if age}} from GOV.UK Verify.
  </p>
  <p>
    Councils should also offer alternative routes to access the service if a user chooses not to use GOV.UK Verify. This should include an online and offline alternatives. See below for more detail on alternatives.

    <h3 class="heading-small">"Unlikely to verify" and "verification failed" pages</h3>

    <p>Some users may not have the documents or credit records that GOV.UK Verify needs to prove their identity.</p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>
        GOV.UK Verify asks users questions to work out if they are likely to be verified. If it looks like they won't be verified, they are shown the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/unlikely-to-verify?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&selection=true&above_age_threshold=false&resident_last_12_months=false&not_resident_reason=NoAddress">unlikely to verify</a>" page.
      </li>
      <li>
        A very small proportion of users will go through past these questions, and GOV.UK Verify will still not be able to verify their identity. These users will be told by their chosen Identity Provider that they couldn't be verified, and then be taken back to GOV.UK, where they will see a similar "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/fail?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&serviceLOA=2&verify=false&security1=&security2=&firstName=&middleName=&lastName=&prevFirstName=&prevMiddleName=&prevLastName=&dob-day=&dob-month=&dob-year=&idp=experian&userLOA=2"> verification failed</a>" page.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both these pages should link to the alternative ways to access the service described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/start-non-verify">Explore the fail to verify user example council page</a>
    </p>


    <h3 class="heading-small">Alternative ways to access the service</h3>

    <p>
      Alternative ways to access the service need to be shown to the user on the "<a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/prove-identity">proving identity</a>" page, the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/unlikely-to-verify?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&selection=true&above_age_threshold=false&resident_last_12_months=false&not_resident_reason=NoAddress">unlikely to verify</a>" page, and the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/fail?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&serviceLOA=2&verify=false&security1=&security2=&firstName=&middleName=&lastName=&prevFirstName=&prevMiddleName=&prevLastName=&dob-day=&dob-month=&dob-year=&idp=experian&userLOA=2"> verification failed</a>" page.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the alternative online route, users will need to prove their address {{"and age" if age}} by scanning in documents. This will require manual checks by councils.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/add-poa">Explore the scan in documents to prove address example council page</a>
    </p>
    {% set addressLink = '<p><a href="/service-patterns/' + serviceString + '/example-service/add-poage">Explore the scan in documents to prove age example council page</a></p>' %}
    {{ addressLink | safe if age }}
    <p>
      Alternative routes should also include the offline ways of accessing the service mentioned on the service start page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councils will provide details to GDS of the above alternative ways to access the service when integrating with GOV.UK Verify.
