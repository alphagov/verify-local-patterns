# Verify Local Patterns

This is a prototype of some content that will be included in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://gov.uk/service-manual) about the best practice for councils to deliver two services - parking permits and concessionary travel. The repo also includes a working prototype of both services which follows the guidance, as deliver by the fictional council of Argleton.

I'm currently using the GitHub project board to manage tasks and iterations.


Here follows the docs ported over from the prototype kit.

# GOV.UK Prototype kit

## About the prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
