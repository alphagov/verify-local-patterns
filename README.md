# Verify Local Patterns


## About this project

This project includes two things:

  - Pattern guidance: This is content that will be included in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://gov.uk/service-manual) outlining best practice for councils to deliver two services - "Apply for a resident's parking permit" and "Apply for an older person's bus pass."
  - A working prototype of both services which follows the pattern. By default this is styled for the fictional council of Argleton, but the prototype can be localised.

## Localising the prototype (Step 1: Initial pull request)

If you are working with a council involved in the #VerifyLocal pilots project, you need to localise the prototype to properly test it for your user research. This involves:

 1. Forking the repository and running it locally
 2. Adding your council options
 3. Adding a council stylesheet and template
 4. Making a pull request

### 1. Forking this repository and running it locally

 - First, [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
 - You'll need to run `npm install` from the command line to install the node modules that the project requires.
 - To start your local server, run `npm start` from the command line.
 - The project will now be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Adding your council options

 - If you navigate to `http://localhost:3000/council-picker`, you should see the councils that have been added so far as options.
 - To add your council as an option, first open `app/councils.json`.
 - Copy one of the other council objects. This will look something like this:

 ```
 {
   "name" : "Argleton County Council",
   "shortName": "Argleton",
   "parkingBoundary": "Argleton City Centre",
   "permitMax": "four",
   "permitsCosts": [51, 81, 153, 153],
   "permitWait": 0,
   "string" : "argleton"
 },
 ```
 *(Every object needs the comma at the end except for the last object. [Read more about valid JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Example).)*

 - Fill in the options relevant to your council.
 - You can delete the parking permits options if you're only doing the bus pass pilot, and vice versa.
 - The `string` option should be lowercase.
 - If you want to see where any option is used, do a project search for the option name in your text editor.

Once you've added your council into `app/councils.json`, your council will show up as an option in `http://localhost:3000/council-picker`. You can select it, but the page will look pretty broken until you do the next step.

If you need to add new options for further localisations, either talk to us on Slack, or raise an issue on Github. For example, if your council doesn't charge anything for permits - Let us know and we'll back it possible for that to be an option in the kit.

### 3. Adding a council stylesheet and template

To make the prototype look like your council's website, you'll need to add CSS and a template HTML file.

It's best to start by copying the Argleton files for both.

 - The council stylesheets are in `app/assets/sass/`. You should name your file with your `string` option set in step 2. For example if your `string` option is `exampleland`, your stylesheet should be `exampleland.scss`
   - The project uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for writing CSS. You don't need to use this though, you can just write normal CSS - But either way, you should save your CSS or SCSS file with a `.scss` file extension.

 - The layout templates are in `lib/`. The file should be called `lib/[string]_template.html`. (eg `lib/exampleland_template.html`). You should use this file to make the prototype look more like your council website. For example, you can add the HTML for your website's header bar in here.
   - The HTML template language is [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). (This allows to use variables and a few other features in HTML.)

Once you've added the above, you should be able to step through your prototype. Do what you can with those two files to make the prototype look like the live service will look on your council's website.

### Optional: Un-govuk-ing your local version

By default, your localised prototype will follow an unbranded version of [GOV.UK elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/). This means form elements, text spacing etc, will look like GOV.UK, but the font will be Helvetica instead of New Transport.

You can turn this of if you want your prototype to look more like your website. To get rid of all GOV.UK-ish styling, do the following:

 1. Remove the `govukish` class from the `<html>` tag in your `lib/[string]_template.html` file.
 2. Remove the lines between the `<!-- start govukish styles -->` and `<!-- end govukish styles -->` also in your `lib/[string]_template.html` file.
 3. Remove the line `@import 'patterns/_govukish.scss';` from your `app/assets/sass/[string].scss` file.

This should leave your version completely unstyled, and you can drop all your council's styling in `app/assets/sass/[string].scss` as you would anyway.

### 4. Making a pull request

Once you're happy with your changes, [make a pull request from your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to merge into the master branch of this repository.

Any questions, ask on Slack!

## Localising the prototype (Step 2: Changing local options)

Some parts of the services are done differently in different places.

We've built features for these things that councils can turn on in the prototype.

Local options currently available:


### `name`

**Example value**: Argleton County Council
**What it is**: The name of your council
**Where it's used**: Wherever a user needs to know what the council will be doing, what data they will hold etc. eg "If you need help, contact {{council.name}}."

### `shortName`

**Example value**: `Argleton`
**What it is**: The colliquial phrasing of the area that the council serves.
**Where it's used**: Whereever the service talks generally about where a user should live. eg "You're eligible for a bus pass in {{council.shortName}}."

### `parkingBoundary`

**Example value**: `Argleton City Centre`
**What it is**: The boundary that the user needs a parking permit for. As this is just a prototype, the first steps in the journey pretend to route the user to the right page for their boundary. Verify later checks they live in the boundary.
**Where it's used**: Whenever the council needs to tell the user about where they can park with the permit they're applying for.

### `permitsCosts`

**Example value**: `[51]`
**What it is**: The price of the permits.
**Where it's used**: Whereever we show users the price of the permits.

### `sixmonth`

**Example value**: `true`
**What it is**: Whether or not the council offers 6 month permits.
**Where it's used**: This removes content about 6 month permits when set to false, and also removes the page where users choose the length of their permit.

### `limitByHousehold`

**Example value**: `true`
**What it is**: Some councils limit permits by household, some limit by resident.
**Where it's used**: Where the service is explaining how permits are allocated on the service page, and when the service tells the user how many permits they are eligible for just after they go through Verify. 

### `permitMax`

**Example value**: `4`
**What it is**: How many permits the user is allowed. (Prototype currently always assumes user is applying for their first permit and the first permit in their household.)
**Where it's used**: Same places as limitByHousehold really.

### `payOnline`

**Example value**: `true`
**What it is**: Some councils do not have an online payment solution.
**Where it's used**: This removes the payment screens and adds content to explain the user will need to pay at the council office.

### `userChoosesStartDate`

**Example value**: `false`
**What it is**: Some councils do not allow users to choose the start date of their permits.
**Where it's used**: There is a page for this that will not show if this is set to `false`.

### `permitWait`

**Example value**: 5
**What it is**: How many working days the user can expect to wait for their permit to arrive at their address.
**Where it's used**: At the start and at the end, when the user needs to know when their permit will arrive.

### `tempPermit`

**Example value**: `true`
**What it is**: Whether or not the council offers a temporary permit.
**Where it's used**: This removes the content telling users they'll need to print a temporary permit.

### `string`

**Example value**: `argleton`
**What it is**: A thing for the URLs.
**Where it's used**: This makes the link to Verify work.

### `boundaryLink`

**Example value**: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argleton`
**What it is**: Details about the parking boundaries for the user.
**Where it's used**: Will display on the start page to tell the user where they can park.

## Using this project

Feel free to fork or use this project for testing government services.

If you fix a bug, or want your changes to be hosted on our Heroku instance for some other reason, feel free to make a pull request.

## Argleton styles

CSS for the Argleton prototype are found in `app/assets/sass/unbranded.scss`.

HTML for the services are found in `app/views/service-patterns/`[service-name]`/example-service`.

## Routes

To change where a user goes when they click options such as radio buttons, you'll need to edit `app/routes.js`. Read more about that in [the prototype kit docs](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/creating-routes).

Here follows the docs ported over from the prototype kit.

## GOV.UK Prototype kit

### About the prototype kit

The prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

Read the [project principles](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/principles).

### Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like GOV.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
